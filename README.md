# Xbox2usbC
An adapter that allows you to plug in USB C wires/devices into the Original Xbox Controller port

Once development is done, this will be available for purchase

# Revision One
This is the, as if yet, untested first variant of the Xbox2usbC. 

Here is a render:

This is the USB C connector used with this design

# Revision 1.1
This revision adds two resistors that allow USB C to USB C functionality and it shortens the runs, lessening the use of copper and lowering the cost. I also did away with some vias, cleaning up the board. This revision still uses the same USB C connector as 1.0.

Here are the resistors used: https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/stackpole-electronics-inc/RNCF0402DTE102K/3479082
As always, gerber files are in the gerber folder.

And here is a 3D render of the top and bottom:

# Revision 2.0

I finally got my hands the 1.1 PCB and found it barely did not fit in the port. I also made the lower part larger to prevent damage of the controller port on the xbox and the USB C port on the Xbox2usbC.

Here's a render of the top of 2.0:

And here's a render of the bottom:

I've placed an order for this version of the PCB to continue testing. Should be here in a couple weeks.
